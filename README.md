### ü§î¬†What is the Block SDK?

> **Note**: The BlockSDK is open source software that Skip maintains. We strive to be responsive to questions and issues within 1-2 weeks - please ask in our [#block-sdk-support discord](https://discord.com/invite/hFeHVAE26P) channel, or open a GitHub issue!

Please note, we are not currently providing hands-on support for new integrations.

**üåê The Block SDK is a toolkit for building customized blocks**. The Block SDK is a set of Cosmos SDK and ABCI++ primitives that allow chains to fully customize blocks to specific use cases. It turns your chain's blocks into a **`highway`** consisting of individual **`lanes`** with their own special functionality.


Skip has built out a number of plug-and-play `lanes` on the SDK that your protocol can use, including in-protocol MEV recapture and Oracles! Additionally, the Block SDK can be extended to add **your own custom `lanes`** to configure your blocks to exactly fit your application needs.
